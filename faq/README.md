## General questions
### Where can I get support?

If you have feature requests or you found a bug you can open a ticket on [openXeco's GitHub repository issue](https://github.com/CybersecurityLuxembourg/openxeco-core/issues) tracker.

### What are the hardware requirements?

From a hardware perspective, openXeco's requirements are in the mid-range, a web server with 4+ cores and 16-24 GB of memory should be plenty, though more is always better of course. A lot of it depends on the data set and the number of users you are dealing with. 

We recommend a standard LAM stack on top of Ubuntu >20.04 LTS. For details on the exact dependencies please refer to the [installation guide](https://doc.openxeco.org/).
